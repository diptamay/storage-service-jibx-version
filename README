After checkout, please read the README.html for the whole description of the services. This example demonstrates a simple in-memory web storage service using jibx and versioning. This is a fork of the original jersey storage service example (which uses jaxb) part of the jersey distro at http://download.java.net/maven/2/com/sun/jersey/samples/jersey-samples/1.4/. Two version of the services have been provided. v1.0 and v1.1. As you would see below there are structural differences in the responses of v1.0 and v1.1. Defining a new version is as simple as defining a new binding xml. Versioned urls are of the form http://127.0.0.1:9998/storage/v1.0/containers/quotes and http://127.0.0.1:9998/storage/v1.1/containers/quotes

If you wish to jump, and start running things, fire up at the command line
mvn clean compile jibx:bind exec:java
This will spin up a embedded grizzly webserver for demo, but definitely take a look at README.html to see what request and responses to expect.

Env used for development:
Java 6.0 (5.0 should work).
Maven 3.0 (2.0 will work as well).

Note: If you wish to run the test cases, aka mvn clean compile jibx:bind test
Be sure to use jersey version 1.1.5 instead of 1.4. Switch it in the pom.xml

Have fun!
